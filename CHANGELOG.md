# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-26

- **Horizons**: yearly / quarterly / monthly goals in periodic notes; projects
  bound to a period (`period:`) and a goal (`goal:`); a Horizons tab, goal
  progress rolled up from projects, goals in Review, period/goal pickers in
  the project form and detail, a boost for current-period work in Plan day.
- Fixed: a loose project note in the projects folder (`02 PROJECTS/X.md`) was
  treated as an umbrella of every project; only folder notes can be.
- New setting **Never index these paths** (archives), defaulting to the
  vault's archive folders.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-26

First build. A ground-up rewrite of the idea behind Task Command Center,
organised around the day.

- Five tabs: Today (the cockpit), Week (drag between days), Projects
  (portfolio → detail with derived phase status and inline add), Inbox
  (capture + triage), Review (weekly health check).
- Rituals: Plan day, Wrap up (with `[>]` records in past notes), weekly
  Review with a checklist.
- One-line natural-language capture with live preview and destination.
- Project note canonical, daily note mirrors, two-way status sync, source →
  mirror everything else; past daily notes never rewritten.
- Habits with derived streaks, rates and heat strips from daily-note ticks.
- Reads the existing `02 PROJECTS` notes (`type: project`, list-or-scalar
  frontmatter, `deadline`/`target_date`/`start_date`) without migration.
- Honours the user's daily template: time-slot lines become time blocks.
- 82 automated tests (parser round-trips, planner, every mutation, jsdom
  renders of every tab and modal) plus an in-app self-test command.
